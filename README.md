# Flowers Forever

This is Emily's frontend learning project; a website for a floral boutique.
The aim of this site is to build a foundational html, CSS, JavaScript website. There is potential scope to rewrite a follow on v2 site using the React Framework.

## Setup

After cloning the repo. Launch the [homepage](./homePage.html) to navigate the site.

## TODO

* Use (cascading) selectors to improve the styling of the site
* Introduce interactivity using vanilla JS
* Run site on an emulator to improve design on different devices
